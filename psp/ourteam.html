                        <h4>MASTER BARBER</h4>
                        <p>Alex came to The Kings Barber Shop from Rawson, where he cut hair for almost 15 years. A gentle soul who carefully  crafts 
                        his haircuts to match the face shape of his clients. When he's not working, you'll find him spending time with  his wife 
                        and baby daughter or watching soccer on television.</p>

                        <p>Charlie's hair runs in the family, as his mother and two older sisters also work in the industry. He believes that the key 
                        to building the most effective client relationship is building comfort and trust. He loves spending time with his friends 
                        watching soccer games.</p>

                        but holds  himself to exacting standards when he's cutting. He loves to reinterpret and modernize classic cuts that he free hands 
                        to shape the face of each client. He will talk about soccer for hours.</p>

                        in his free time. His signature cut is the 1950s pompadour, which is a very labor-intensive cut and currently back in vogue.</p>
