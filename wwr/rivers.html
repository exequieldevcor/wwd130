                    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2><br>
                    <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was<br>
                        given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of <br>
                        the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river <br>
                        that they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and <br>
                        bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring <br>
                        ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun <br>
                        or rain when needed. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one <br>
                        of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, <br>
                        faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are <br>
                        good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the<br>
                        late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p><br>

                    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2><br>
                    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river<br>
                        flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery,<br> 
                        and great rapids have made this run famous. <br>
                        This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah)<br>
                        and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic <br>
                        human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.<br>
                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.<br>
                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the<br>
                        uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p><br>

                    <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2><br>
                    <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget<br>
                    your visit to the Grand Canyon.<br>
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one<br>
                    truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids,<br> 
                    but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.<br>
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are<br>
                    technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.<br> 
                    However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p><br>
